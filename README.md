LinkedList1 ll = new LinkedList1();
ll.addFirst(1);
ll.addLast(2);
ll.addLast(3);
ll.addLast(4);
ll.addLast(5);

// Check for cycle
System.out.println(ll.isCycle()); // false

// Create a cycle
ll.head.next.next.next.next.next = ll.head;

// Check again
System.out.println(ll.isCycle()); // true
```
